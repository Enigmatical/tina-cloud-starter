  I originally bought this game in 2003 when it was released for the PS2 after
  amazingly high critical reviews. At the time, I'd played -some- of Dark Cloud
  1, but this game was supposed to be such an improvement on that formula that I
  couldn't help it.


  I don't even know what sort of money I had in 2003...


  Anyway, having finished Dark Cloud 1 at the end of December (and thoroughly
  hating it), I knew that Dark Cloud 2 would be better. And it is - but it still
  has a lot of the same problems. Dark Cloud 2 is a better game because the
  repetitive nature of dungeon crawling is covered by so many other activities -
  4 essentially different characters (though I never touched Monster
  Transformation), fishing, golfing (ahem, Spheda), world-building, medal
  chasing, weapon building...


  This is a game that heralds having a "100+ Hour Adventure" as a bullet point
  on the back.


  I enjoyed my time with it; it's a very good game. When I was... 16-17, this
  would've been my dream game.
